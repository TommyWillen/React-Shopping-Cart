## Description

This app is my first attempt at a frontend React shopping cart app using typescript. This app displays products that can be viewed and then added/removed to a cart that displays as an aside. Click [here](https://github.com/TommyWillen/React-Shopping-Cart) to view the deployed app.

## Installation

Create the initial react using: npx create-react-app "someAppName"
To install dependencies you need to perform npm i
You will also need to use the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.herokuapp.com/) for the shopping cart items.

## Usage

![React shopping cart functionality](/public/assets/images/shopping-cart-functionality-gif.gif)

To use this app you will need to create a react app using create-react-app and install the dependencies using node.js. This app uses material-ui for some of its components. From the api call the store products are mapped into an array to display the store. I also included cart icon in the top right side to display when items are added to the cart that opens as an aside.

I would like to eventually include a way to convert this into a full stack app and include a backend with authentication so the user can save their cart and possible make purchases using a dummy paypal account.
